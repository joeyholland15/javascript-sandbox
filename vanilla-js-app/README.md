This directory contains the base files for a very simple JavaScript application. The main files are:
* index.html (for writing HTML to create the bones of our application)
* app.css (for writing CSS to add styles to our application)
* script.js (for writing JavaScript to bring our application to life!)

If you are using VSCode, you should install the Live Server plugin.

Once installed, this plugin will allow us to run our app directly in the browser. To do this, run `command + shift + P` and select `Live Server: Open with Live Server`. You should see the app boot up in your browser.
